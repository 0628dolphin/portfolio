            <p>My name is Mannat Dhot and I am a Freshman at Dublin High School. I have always been interested in the business world and exploring the role technology plays in the success of a business. When I grow up I want to be a business woman. A business woman is a female executive that leads the company and helps them grow their profits and business. I have the confidence, passion, and determination to be successful in this job. Our future is based heavily on technology and I want to learn the basics of programming and engineering in high school, so that I can apply them later on and help my company grow. In order to reach my goal, I have taken a Computer Science Class to learn how to code and joined DECA (a business club) to further enrich my knowledge. </p>

            <p>Last  year, I was the Vice-President of my school’s CJSF (California Junior Scholarship Federation) Chapter. I organized The Hunger Games Canned Food Drive, and helped my school raise 6,000 pounds of canned food (the second highest in the county). During the first week we were getting very limited donations, so I stepped in and worked with my team to change the format so that it became a school-wide competition. We ended up getting a record breaking amount of donations. Through this I learned the importance of perserverance. I had set a goal for me and my team, and through hard work and determination we were able to reach it. As a businesswoman, I will continue to do set goals in order to help my bussiness flourish. </p>

            <p> This past year, during the Coronavirus Pandemic I decided to finally pursue one of my passions and I started a blog. My blog is much like any other, I share recipes of baked goods, reviews of Netflix movies and information about the life of a high schooler in quarantine. At first, my blog only had 3 viewers, but I started spreading the word, made an instagram account and now I am at 20. My goal is to have 100 viewers by the end of the year.</p>

            <p>As a member of my school’s debate team I have won constant awards. Last year, I won The Golden Gavel Debate Award: This award is given to the top speaker at every tournament. Debating has helped me gain confidence. I am not scared to share my ideas in a crowd. Nor am I scared to take on a leadership position. Debate has helped me become more confident in my self and taught me how to present complicated ideas in a simple way. At the start of this academic year (September 2019), I was given the oppurnity to further practice this skill. I was offered a internship with Bay Area Bhangra Empire. Bay Area Bhangra Empire is the largest Punjabi Folk Dance Academy in all of North America. My task was simple; I had to assist with choreography and teaching for the Dublin beginner and intermediate classes. Teaching gave me the chance to learn how to explain complicated moves to students, who have not learned them before. I became more confident in my self, and learned how to work productively to come up with new ideas for routines as well. All of these experiences will help when I lead my company in the future.</p>
            <p>As you can see I have the passions, skills, and determination to be successful in the business world. Thank your time and patience, and I wish the best of luck as you explore the rest of this site!</p>
