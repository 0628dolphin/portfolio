          <p>The main objective of this project was to design an user interactive game by using the programming language Scratch. My partner and I both wanted to develop a game that requires players to think out of the box. So, we decided to make an escape room simulation game. In this game there is a set amount of time given to the player who tries to escape using the clues and sprites in the room. Each level increases in difficulty as the game moves along. For this project, my parter and I both split up the work evenly and I developed levels 1 and 3, while my partner worked on the home screen and level 2. For level 1 I had to think creatively to try to come up with new challnges our viewers hadn't seen before, in order to keep them interested in the game. This taught me about the importance of design creativity, and orginiality. Throughout the project, one main challenge I faced was adding elements to level 3. This was the most challenging level of our game, and hence the most challenging to code. I had to code additonal costumes and variables to ensure it is more difficult than the others. By overcoming this challenge, I learned more about the features on the programming language Scratch- such as costumes, and time variables. But more importantly, I learned about how to keep track of my work through efficient documentation and comments, so that others can understand the game and our thought proccess better. </p>

          <p>The objective of this project was to execute a series of manipulations onto a set of images based on the needs of a certain client. The programming language used was Python. The client I choose to work with was Client #2, The Family. I chose this client because I liked this clientâ€™s criteria and knew I could have fun executing their vision. Client 2 was looking for a unique border, and some geometric shapes or symbols. I started with the unique border, and played around with different masks. My first idea was a border consisting of mini triangles, but I realized that seemed a little traditional. I continued to work with different combinations of squares, circles and triangles and finally settled on a unique geometric border with 2 rounded corners and 2 cut corners. This process of trial and error taught me that when working in Computer Science, sometimes your first idea is not always the best or the one to choose. You have to be determined to find the right solution, not the quick solution. The second thing my client wanted was geometrics shapes or symbols. I picked two symbols: a heart showcasing a family, and an infinity sign. This is when the challenge came in. In previous activities we had learned how to copy one image on top of another, but for my manipulation I wanted to copy 2 images onto a set of images. To overcome this challenge, I read the code closely and added my symbols onto 1 image. I then altered the code a little bit, so it could be applied to a different function and ultimately onto the full image set. For this project I chose to work alone, and hence did all the manipulations myself. As a whole, this project helped me improve my python programming skills and also taught me the importance of brainstorming and having multiple options available in case things do not turn out the way you expected. </p>
